# Module 02: Control Flow

## 🌟 Overview

Welcome to Module 02! This module introduces **control flow**, the mechanism that allows your program to make decisions and repeat actions.

### 🎯 Key Concepts:

- **Conditionals**: Making decisions with `if`, `elif`, and `else`.
- **Loops**: Repeating blocks of code with `for` and `while`.
- **Break and Continue**: Controlling loop execution.
- **Range Function**: Generating sequences of numbers.

## 📚 What is Control Flow?

Control flow determines the order in which statements are executed. Without control flow, a program is just a sequence of instructions executed from top to bottom. With control flow, your program can:

- Skip code based on conditions.
- Execute code multiple times.
- Break out of loops early.

## 🛠 Prerequisites from Module 01

- Understanding of booleans (`True`, `False`)
- Comparison operators (`==`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=`)
- Logical operators (`and`, `or`, `not`)

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. **Review the concepts**: Read through this file and run `main.py` to see examples in action.
2. **Practice**: Open `exercises.py` and implement the tasks.
3. **Check Solutions**: Compare your work with `solutions.py`.
4. **Test Your Knowledge**: Run `quiz.py` to take a quick quiz.
5. **Reference**: Use `cheat-sheet.md` for a quick syntax guide.

## 📝 Example: If Statement

```python
age = 20
if age >= 18:
    print("You are an adult.")
else:
    print("You are a minor.")
```

## 📝 Example: For Loop

```python
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
for fruit in fruits:
    print(fruit)
```

Happy coding! 🎉
