# Module 05: File Handling & Exceptions

## 🌟 Overview

In this module, you'll learn how to read from and write to clear text files, manage file paths, and gracefully handle errors using exceptions.

### 🎯 Key Concepts:

- **`open()`**: The built-in function to work with files.
- **Modes**: `r` (read), `w` (write), `a` (append).
- **Context Managers (`with`)**: Safely managing file resources.
- **Exceptions (`try`, `except`, `finally`)**: Making your code robust.

### 🚀 Examples in `main.py`

- Reading `data.txt`.
- Writing logs.
- Catching `ZeroDivisionError` and `FileNotFoundError`.

### 📚 Exercises

Practice handling CSV-like data and error-proofing your functions in `exercises.py`.
