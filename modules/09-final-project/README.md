# Module 09: Final Project - Task Manager CLI

## 🌟 Overview

Congratulations! You've made it to the final project. In this module, you will build a complete **Task Manager Command Line Interface (CLI)** application from scratch.

This project will combine everything you've learned: variables, loops, functions, file handling, and error management.

### 🎯 Project Goals:

1.  **Add Tasks**: Allow users to add new tasks.
2.  **View Tasks**: List all current tasks.
3.  **Complete Tasks**: Mark tasks as done.
4.  **Delete Tasks**: Remove tasks from the list.
5.  **Save/Load Data**: PErsuist tasks to a JSON file so data isn't lost when the program closes.

### 🛠 File Structure

- `task_manager.py`: The main application logic.
- `tasks.json`: The data file (created automatically).

### 🚀 How to Run

```bash
python task_manager.py
```

### 📚 Challenge

Try adding a "Due Date" feature or categories to the tasks!
