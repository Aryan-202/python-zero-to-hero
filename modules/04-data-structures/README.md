# Module 04: Data Structures

Welcome to Module 04! In this module, you'll learn about Python's built-in data structures, which are essential for organizing and managing data effectively.

## 📚 Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will be able to:
- Create and manipulate lists, tuples, dictionaries, and sets
- Understand the differences between mutable and immutable data structures
- Use list comprehensions for concise data transformation
- Choose the right data structure for different scenarios
- Work with nested data structures
- Perform common operations on each data type

## 🎯 What You'll Learn

- **Lists**: Ordered, mutable sequences
- **Tuples**: Ordered, immutable sequences
- **Dictionaries**: Key-value pairs for fast lookups
- **Sets**: Unordered collections of unique elements
- **List Comprehensions**: Concise way to create lists
- **Nested Structures**: Combining data structures

## 📖 Topics Covered

1. List operations and methods
2. Tuple immutability and unpacking
3. Dictionary key-value pairs
4. Set theory operations
5. When to use each data structure
6. Performance considerations

## ⏰ Estimated Time

- Reading: 45 minutes
- Exercises: 60 minutes
- Total: 1 hour 45 minutes

## 🚀 Prerequisites

- Completion of Module 03: Functions and Modules
- Understanding of variables and basic data types
- Familiarity with loops and conditionals

## 💡 Key Concepts

- **Mutable** objects can be changed after creation (lists, dictionaries, sets)
- **Immutable** objects cannot be changed after creation (tuples, strings, numbers)
- **Hashable** objects can be used as dictionary keys (immutable types)
- **Comprehensions** provide a concise way to create collections
